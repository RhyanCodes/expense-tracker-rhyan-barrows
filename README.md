Personal expense tracking application

## Overview 
This app will help users organize and see where there money goes on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. Users will be able to put their different expenses into individual categories. Totals will be kept so yearly changes can be seen. 

## Problem Statement 
Some people need help with the math of their expenses so this app will do that for them. 
Existing solutions fall short because it may just be an excel table and it is not easy to see changes.
I will address the pain points of users needing guidance with spending/budgeting by inputing an AI model, make it easy to see expenses by categorizing them (rent, bills, groceries, etc.)
